# FF-Container-Default-Pages
This is a Firefox browser extension that lets you specify a default page for each container.

This is still in initial development phase, prior to release on the addon-store. 

Last update has the extension with all basic functionalities. That is, it has an interface that lists all the current containers with their icons and names. It also list and input box next to each container where the user can input URLs as default pages for each container. The extension then stores the URLs accordingly and every time the user opens a new link in a container, its corresponding default page will load automatically. There are still areas that need polishing including:
- Frontend responsive design
- Frontend accessibility
- backend garbage collection
- Overall cross checks
